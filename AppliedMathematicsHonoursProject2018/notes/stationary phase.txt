Whenever a differential equation is linear, we may derive exact solutions corresponding to a particular dispersion mode with fourier integrals and analyze these solutions for large values of $t$ using the method of stationary phase. Stationary phase refers to the phase of the solution $\phi$ being stationary. Hence, assuming a fourier integral solution, $$\phi(x,t)=\int_\infty^{-\infty}F(\kappa)e^{i\big(\kappa x-W(\kappa)t\big)}d\kappa,$$ the stationary phase is defined by a phase which does not change with respect to time. But, $t$ depends on $\omega$ which depends on $\kappa$ and $\vec{\kappa}$. So, the stationary phase is determined by points in the instantaneous phase, such that magnitude of the gradient, $\kappa$, does not change for a fixed gradient $\vec{\kappa}$. I.e.,
$$\frac{d}{d\kappa}\big(\kappa x-W(\kappa)t\big)=0.$$
This is the method used in \cite{Whitham}. Recall, $\vec{\kappa}$ defines the surface of an instantaneous phase, $\theta=$ constant, that depends on $t$. A stationary point is a point with coordinates in the 4-dimensional plane of space and time that does not change position with respect to a change in time coordinates. After a change in time, there may be time dependence in the spatial coordinates or spatial dependence in the time coordinate. I.e., after a change in time the phase surface may be the same, but point masses are exchanged in the process. This is a subtle case which may occur here and accounts for group velocity whenever dispersion is present. Recall, for the dispersion of modes we consider phase surfaces $\theta=$ constant. The propagation of identical and instantaneously varying phase surfaces corresponds to the group velocity, where instantaneous phase surfaces move with a speed determined by their respective wavenumber velocities. The instantaneous (equivalently local) wavenumbers move with the group velocity of phase surfaces.

Next we follow the arguments in \cite{Whitham} with respect to stationary phase to construct an approximate solution, $\phi$. Kelvin developed the method of stationary phase for this particular problem. Let $k(x,t)$ represent the stationary points of a fixed phase surface $\theta(\vec{\kappa},\omega)=\theta(\vec{\kappa},t)=$ constant. He concluded that when $$F(\kappa)$$ and $$\chi(\kappa)=W(\kappa)-\kappa\frac{x}{t}$$ are expanded in Taylor series centered at $\kappa=k$, the largest contribution to the fourier integral $\phi$ is from 
$$F(\kappa)\simeq F(k)$$
and
$$\chi(\kappa)\simeq\chi(k)+(\kappa-k)^2\chi ''(k)$$ by letting $t\rightarrow\infty$. This is concluded by applying the method of steepest descents to these Taylor expansions taken to powers of $(\kappa-k)^2$ for $F(\kappa)$ and $(\kappa-k)^4$ for $\chi(\kappa)$, where terms beyond these are inverse powers of $t$ and go to zero as $t\rightarrow\infty$.
The conclusion of the arguments in \cite{Whitham} is that $$\phi\sim \mathlarger{\sum} F(k)\sqrt{\frac{2\pi}{t\vert W''(k)\vert}}exp\bigg(ikx-iW(k)t-i\frac{\pi}{4}sgnW''(k)\bigg)$$ such that $t\rightarrow\infty$, $x>0$, the sum is over stationary points $k$ and $k(x,t)$ is defined by the positive root, $k$, of
\begin{equation}
W'(k)-\frac{x}{t}=0.
\label{groupvelocity1.eqn}
\end{equation}
Note that $sgnW''(k)$ is the sign of $W''(k)$ for the positive root $k$ and that we ensured $W''(k)\neq0$ by the definition of dispersion.

Next, the conclusions of applying the asymptotic method will be summarized further in the context of phase surfaces. The instantaneous phase, $\theta(\vec{\kappa},\omega)$, determines a function $k(x,t)$ of the points, $x$, in the phase surfaces $\theta(\vec{\kappa},\omega)$ that are stationary with respect to $t$. For sufficiently large $t$, these stationary points are approximately equivalent to the points on the phase surface $\theta(\vec{\kappa},\omega)$ by Kelvin. Intuitively, these conclusions are based on the idea of 3-dimensional points having components which are related by a single variable and so variations in 3-dimensions can be represented by total derivatives of a single variable. This must be true to remain consistent with the previous analysis of phase surfaces that was used to define dispersion and continuity. Recall that a phase surface is fixed by $\vec{\kappa}$ and has spatial gradient with magnitude $\kappa$ at some time, $t$, and is the average variation. Hence, the average wavenumber, $\kappa$, is equal to the magnitude of local variation (equivalently local wavenumber) for fixed points represented by $k(x,t)$ for large $t$. Let $\varepsilon>0$. Thus, $\phi$ is a good approximation for $\vert\kappa -k\vert<\varepsilon$. By taking $\varepsilon\rightarrow 0$ we may take $\kappa=k$ in the dispersion relation (\ref{dispersionrelation.eqn}). It is precisely the spatial and temporal variations of phase that characterize the dispersion and group velocity. The asymptotic method is one way of untangling the duality of dispersion and group velocity, but it is restricted to large values of $t$. This condition on $t$ is equivalent to the condition that $k(x,t)$ is slowly varying with respect to time. By the same token, the amplitude $A$ must be slowly varying.
