# HonoursProject_Mathematics_CarletonUniversity

Contains all files associated to honours project report and presentation about linear dispersive waves in optical fibers. This report also demonstrates typesetting a formal research document and slide show with LaTeX. I used MikTeX version 2.9 with the TeXWorks editor. These are free to download and install for those wishing to view the raw .tex files in the TeXWorks editor.
